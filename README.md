# HearthstoneCardStatCorrelations
A fork of [Yawar Raza](https://github.com/YawarRaza7349)'s **[YuGiOhCardStatCorrelations](https://github.com/YawarRaza7349/YuGiOhCardStatCorrelations)** used to visualize card stats in a graph. For the more intricate details, visit his repository. He wrote virtually all of the important code - I just wrote the stuff to make it work with Hearthstone cards.

The card list is taken from http://hearthstonejson.com/.
